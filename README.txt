This is my personal website! 

INDEX.html
links to the jquery library, and my personal js and css files.
This contains a navigation menu list, and sections: home, about, languages, 
manifesto and contact.
Home- background photo & name
About - three divs that serve as buttons. (1) interests, (2) experience, and 
(3) education. Below each div is another div "slideOut" that contains a div
"innerSlide", containing a list of things pertaining to each of the button 
headers. 
Languages - this has a bunch of divs of the "circle floater" class representing 
the languages I know.
Manifesto - here's a picture of me and a little monologue about why I think 
Computer Science can use the field of Economics to create equal oportunity.
Contact - a mailto link to my email address.

PERSONAL.css
Here live the styles for my website (colors, padding, positioning...)

PERSONAL.js
Here is some simply jQuery code to do the following:
-float scroll effect
-insert "back to top" button (just the ^ symbol)
-only show back to top button when scrolled past home section
-section sizes determined by window sizes
-hide slideout elements
-toggle (display / hide) slide elements when clicked
-add class to button elements when hovered over
